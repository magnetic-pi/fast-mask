#### Objective

The **Filter Adapted Snorkel Tube** (F.A.S.T) Mask is an attempt to help ease the burden facing medical staff around the world due to the shortage of face shields, eye protection, and N95 masks. The goal of this project was to find easy to obtain parts and modify them to provide a cheap reusable (PPE) mask solution.

The F.A.S.T project modifies an existing snorkel mask, so that a PM2.5, N95, P95 or other similar filters can be easily retrofitted to a modified snorkel tube. F.A.S.T provides an added advantage, as the filter masks are no longer touching a user's face directly, which helps to preserve the filters. Doctors and nurses are currently required to use the face masks for a days at a time, and that's if they are lucky enough to have access to a mask at all. The F.A.S.T solution could potentially provide a way to immediately double existing filter supplies on location, as well as increase/improve filter reusability and sharing. The F.A.S.T adapter provides an easily maintainable and reusable face shield solution for front line responders. Due to its modularity, the various parts of F.A.S.T can be quickly disassembled, sanitized, reused, and replaced. The various types of masks (N95, PM2.5) never directly touch the users face, therefore making it so masks can easily be sterilized in accordance to [sterilization studies](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22680799) and reused.

Currently the Covid-19 virions are about 0.125 microns in size. This means that the PM2.5 filter may not completely protect users, however, neither will wearing an improperly fitted P95/N95 masks which often have leaks based on fit to the face. The F.A.S.T Mask also provides enhanced protection by eliminating the gaps typically found when wearing separate N95 masks, face shields, and eye protection.

This project was inspired by and is dedicated to [Dr. Usama Riaz](https://old.reddit.com/r/HumansBeingBros/comments/fnwflk/dr_usama_riaz_has_spent_weeks_screening_treating/) and the many other selfless heroes around the world who are on the front lines fighting the good fight against Covid-19.

#### Design Objectives
1. Protect users' entire face.
2. Keep the filter as isolated and clean as possible. (No facial oil contamination and mitigate direct body fluid exposure.)
3. No tooling required.
4. Easy sterilization.
5. Reusability.
6. Parts must be easily acquirable globally.
7. Provide a consistent seal between the filter and filter holder.
    
#### Build Steps
The build steps can be found in: [stl-files/INSTRUCTIONS.md](https://github.com/magnetic-pi/fast-mask/blob/master/stl-files/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

#### Licensing
The F.A.S.T components are free and open source to ensure the interoperability of F.A.S.T with various mask vendors, and to encourage rapid development by others.
